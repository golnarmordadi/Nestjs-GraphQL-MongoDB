## Description
This is a sample that created with Nestjs and Typescript. 

*Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications.

*Typescript provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces. One of the big benefits is to enable IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code.
